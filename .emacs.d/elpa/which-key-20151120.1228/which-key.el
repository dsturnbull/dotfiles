;;; Commentary:

;; which-key is a minor mode for Emacs that displays the key bindings following
;; your currently entered incomplete command (a prefix) in a popup. For example,
;; after enabling the minor mode if you enter C-x and wait for the default of 1
;; second the minibuffer will expand with all of the available key bindings that
;; follow C-x (or as many as space allows given your settings). This includes
;; prefixes like C-x 8 which are shown in a different face. Screenshots of what
;; the popup will look like along with information about additional features can
;; be found at https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key.
;;
;; which-key started as a rewrite of guide-key
;; (https://github.com/kai2nenobu/guide-key), but the feature sets have since
;; diverged.
